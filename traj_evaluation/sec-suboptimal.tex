%In particular, the state-of-the-art the sub-optimal line simplification approaches can be classified into three categories.


This section elaborates the-state-of-the-art sub-optimal algorithms solving the \emph{min-$\#$} problem of trajectory simplification according to the taxonomy in Section~\ref{sec-intro}.
