%In particular, the state-of-the-art the sub-optimal line simplification approaches can be classified into three categories.


This section reviews the seven techniques evaluated in our experiments, namely,
(i) Douglas-Peucker (\dpa)\cite{Douglas:Peucker,Meratnia:Spatiotemporal} and \pavlidis (\tpa)~\cite{Pavlidis:Segment}, two distinct batch algorithms applying the \emph{global checking policy},
(ii) \bqsa\cite{Liu:BQS} and \squishe~\cite{Muckell:SQUISH}, online algorithms applying the \emph{constrained global checking} policy, %\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\opwa, \swab  and}
and (iii) \operb\cite{Lin:Operb}, sector intersection (\sia)~\cite{Williams:Longest,Sklansky:Cone,Dunham:Cone, Zhao:Sleeve} and spatio-temporal cone intersection using \sed~(\cia)~\cite{Lin:Cised}, one-pass algorithms applying the \emph{local checking} policy.
