%In particular, the state-of-the-art the sub-optimal line simplification approaches can be classified into three categories.


This section reviews the sub-optimal \lsa algorithms from the point of view of the distance checking policies they applied, namely, (1) batch algorithms that apply the global distance checking policy, (2) online algorithms that apply the constraint global distance checking policy, and (3) one-pass algorithms that apply the local distance checking policy.
