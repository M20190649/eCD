\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
Effectiveness (compression ratios and average errors) and efficiency are used to evaluate these algorithms.

\stitle{Compression ratios.}
Given a set of trajectories $\{\dddot{\mathcal{T}_1}, \ldots, \dddot{\mathcal{T}_M}\}$ and their piecewise line representations $\{\overline{\mathcal{T}_1}, \ldots, \overline{\mathcal{T}_M}\}$,
the compression ratio is $(\sum_{j=1}^{M} |\overline{\mathcal{T}}_j |)/(\sum_{j=1}^{M} |\dddot{\mathcal{T}}_j |)$.
By this definition, algorithms with lower compression ratios are better.

\stitle{Average error.}
Given a set of trajectories $\{\dddot{\mathcal{T}_1}, \ldots, \dddot{\mathcal{T}_M}\}$ and their piecewise line representations
$\{\overline{\mathcal{T}_1}, \ldots, \overline{\mathcal{T}_M}\}$, and $P_{j,i}$ denoting
a point in trajectory $\dddot{\mathcal{T}}_j$ contained in a line segment $\mathcal{L}_{l,i}\in\overline{\mathcal{T}_l}$ ($l\in[1,M]$),
then the average error is $\sum_{j=1}^{M}\sum_{i=0}^{M} d(P_{j,i},
\mathcal{L}_{l,i})/\sum_{j=1}^{M}{|\dddot{\mathcal{T}}_j |}$.

\stitle{Efficiency.}
Efficiency describes the speed of compressing trajectories. We load and compress trajectories one by one, and only count the running time of the compressing process.

\subsubsection{Evaluation of Compression Effectiveness}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the first set of tests, we compare the effectiveness (compression ratios and average errors) of these algorithms.% using \ped and \sed, respectively.

\stitle{Exp-1.1: Compression ratios}. 
To compare the compression ratios of these algorithms and evaluate the impacts of $\epsilon$ on them, we varied $\epsilon$ from $10m$ to $100m$ on the entire four datasets, respectively.
The results are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:cr-ped} and Figure~\ref{fig:cr-sed}.


\sstab (1) When increasing $\epsilon$, the compression ratios decrease. 
%For example, in \mopsi, the compression ratios are greater than {$4\%$} when $\epsilon$ = $10m$, and less than {$2\%$} when $\epsilon$ = $100m$.

\sstab (2) Dataset \act has the lowest compression ratios, compared with \ucar, \geolife and \mopsi, due to its highest sampling rate, \ucar has the highest compression ratios due to its lowest sampling rate, and \geolife and \mopsi have the compression ratios in the middle accordingly.

\sstab (3) When using \ped, the compression ratios from the best
to the worst are the optimal algorithm \optp, online algorithm \bqsa, batch algorithms \tpa and
\dpa, and one-pass algorithms \siped and \operb. 
The output sizes of algorithm \bqsa are on average
($113.6\%$, $120.2\%$, $120.8\%$, $120.9\%$) of the optimal algorithm \optp
on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively. 
Algorithms \tpa and \dpa are comparable, and their output sizes are on average
($124.74\%$, $131.01\%$, $138.01\%$, $124.46\%$) and ($129.95\%$, $140.56\%$,
$139.00\%$, $126.05\%$) of \optp
on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
Algorithms \siped and \operb are comparable, and they are on average
($137.27\%$, $150.23\%$, $152.29\%$, $136.61\%$)
and ($143.37\%$, $147.80\%$, $152.37\%$, $137.19\%$) of \optp on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
%
For example, in \mopsi, the compression ratios of algorithms
(\optp, \tpa, \dpa, \bqsa, \siped, \operb ) are ($1.6\%$, $2.2\%$, $2.2\%$, $1.9\%$, $2.4\%$, $2.4\%$) when $\epsilon$ = $40m$.

\sstab (4) When using \sed, the compression ratios from the best
to the worst are the near optimal algorithm \nopts, batch algorithms \tpa and
\dpa, one-pass algorithm \cised, and online algorithm \squishe. Algorithms \tpa
and \dpa are comparable, and they are on average
($122.69\%$, $129.08\%$, $131.97\%$, $131.01\%$) and ($121.36\%$, $129.27\%$, $130.11\%$, $126.21\%$)
 of the near optimal algorithm \nopts on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi,
 \act), respectively.
 Algorithms \cised and \squishe are on average ($132.07\%$, $139.67\%$,
 $146.56\%$, $135.10\%$) and ($164.47\%$, $189.87\%$, $213.30\%$, $186.72\%$)
 of \nopts on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
 %
For example, in \mopsi, the compression ratios of algorithms
(\nopts, \tpa, \dpa, \squishe, \cised)
are ($2.62\%$, $3.45\%$, $3.41\%$, $5.75\%$, $3.86\%$), respectively, when $\epsilon$ = $40m$. 

\sstab (5) The compression ratios of algorithms using \ped are obviously better
than using \sed.
More specifically, the compression ratios of algorithms \optp, \tpa and \dpa
using \ped are on average ($42.17\%$, $46.77\%$, $60.37\%$, $40.76\%$),
($42.88\%$, $47.49\%$, $63.15\%$, $38.62\%$) and ($45.17\%$, $50.88\%$,
$64.50\%$, $40.63\%$) of algorithms \nopts, \tpa and \dpa using \sed on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.

\stitle{Exp-1.2: Average errors}.
To compare the average errors of these algorithms and evaluate the impacts of $\epsilon$ on them, we varied $\epsilon$ from $10m$ to $100m$ on the entire four datasets, respectively.
The results are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:ae-ped} and Figure~\ref{fig:ae-sed}.


\sstab (1) When increasing $\epsilon$, the average errors increase linearly. 

\sstab (2) Datasets have few impacts on the average errors.

\sstab (3) When using \ped, the average errors from the smallest
to the largest are batch algorithms \tpa and \dpa, one-pass
algorithms \siped and \operb, the optimal algorithm \optp and online algorithm \bqsa. 
Algorithms \tpa and
\dpa are comparable, and they are on average ($58.60\%$, $61.34\%$,
$57.57\%$, $54.82\%$) and ($57.56\%$, $62.66\%$, $60.23\%$, $52.68\%$) of the optimal algorithm \optp on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
Algorithms \siped and \operb are comparable, and they are on average
($80.88\%$, $79.12\%$, $79.33\%$, $81.05\%$), ($70.64\%$, $76.64\%$, $78.71\%$, $70.94\%$) of \optp on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
Algorithm \bqsa is on average ($104.8\%$, $108.9\%$, $106.9\%$, $110.4\%$) of \optp on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
%
For example, in \mopsi, the average errors of algorithms
(\optp, \tpa, \dpa, \bqsa, \siped, \operb ) are ($16.08$, $9.19$, $9.68$, $17.4$, $12.96$, $12.77$)  metres when $\epsilon$ = $40m$.

\sstab (4) When using \sed, the average errors from the smallest
to the largest are online algorithm \squishe, batch algorithms \tpa and \dpa,
one-pass algorithm \cised, and the near optimal algorithm \nopts.
Algorithms \tpa and \dpa are comparable, and they are on average
($64.62\%$, $64.06\%$, $62.53\%$, $57.40\%$), ($65.03\%$, $63.72\%$, $62.54\%$, $57.95\%$) of the near optimal algorithm \nopts on datasets (\ucar, \geolife,
\mopsi, \act), respectively.
Algorithms \cised and \squishe are on average ($74.06\%$, $75.77\%$, $75.35\%$, $75.81\%$), ($41.75\%$, $38.50\%$, $35.19\%$, $36.90\%$) of \nopts on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
%
For example, in \mopsi, the average errors of algorithms
(\nopts, \tpa, \dpa, \squishe, \cised) are ($19.40$, $12.17$, $12.20$, $6.76$, $14.71$) metres, respectively, when $\epsilon$ = $40m$.

\sstab (5) The average errors of algorithms using \sed are a bit larger than using \ped. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{-1ex}
\subsubsection{Evaluation of Compression Efficiency}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the second set of tests, we compare the efficiency (execution time) of these algorithms.
%For fairness, we load and compress trajectories one by one, and only count the running time of the compressing process.
%For a small size trajectory, we repeat compress it tens of times and accumulation the total running time so as  to get the average compression time.


\stitle{Exp-2.1: Impacts of the error bound $\epsilon$}.
To evaluate the impacts of $\epsilon$ on efficiencies of these algorithms, we varied $\epsilon$ from $10m$ to $100m$ on the entire four datasets, respectively.
%
The results show that the running time of algorithms \optp and \nopts are on
average ($261.71$, $334.49$, $403.56$, $202.82$) and ($334.31$, $382.80$, $555.73$, $119.73$) times slower than one-pass algorithms \siped and \cised on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively. 
For example, in \mopsi, the running time of algorithms
(\optp, \nopts, \siped, \cised) are  {($3014.2$, $4969.1$, $7.5$, $9.8$)} seconds when $\epsilon$ = $40m$.
%
It is not easy to show all these algorithms in a figure, thus, only the results of sub-optimal algorithms are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:time-epsilon-ped} and Figure~\ref{fig:time-epsilon-sed}.

\sstab (1) One-pass algorithms are not very sensitive to error bound $\epsilon$. 
More specifically, the running time of algorithms \dpa and \tpa decreases and increases with the increase of $\epsilon$ due to the top-down and bottom-up approaches they applying, respectively. It also shows that \dpa is more suitable than \tpa in circumstances that compression ratios are less than $\sim 10\%$.

\sstab (2) When using \ped, in most cases, the running time from the smallest to the largest are one-pass algorithms \siped and \operb, batch algorithms \tpa and \dpa, and online algorithm \bqsa. 
Algorithms \siped and \operb are comparable, and algorithms \tpa, \dpa and \bqsa are on average
($19.19$, $26.79$, $28.25$, $29.87$), ($17.90$, $16.32$, $15.40$, $11.02$) and ($15.07$, $37.73$, $62.23$, $61.29$)
times slower than the one-pass algorithm \siped on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
% 
For example, in \mopsi, the running time of algorithms
(\tpa, \dpa, \bqsa, \siped, \operb ) are ($232.9$, $124.2$, $469.4$, $7.6$, $8.6$) seconds when $\epsilon$ = $40m$.

\sstab (3) When using \sed, the running time from the smallest to the largest are one-pass algorithm \cised, online algorithm \squishe, and batch algorithms \tpa and \dpa. 
Algorithms \tpa, \dpa and \squishe are on average
($8.58$, $13.33$, $15.81$, $13.09$), ($12.81$, $12.93$, $10.64$, $8.79$) and
($2.63$, $2.75$, $2.78$, $2.57$) times slower than \cised on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.
%
For example, in \mopsi, the running time of algorithms
(\tpa, \dpa, \squishe, \cised) are  ($156.6$, $104.8$, $27.2$, $9.7$) seconds when $\epsilon$ = $40m$.

\sstab (4) Batch algorithms \dpa and \tpa using \sed run a bit faster than using
\ped, while the one-pass algorithm \cised run $1.3$ times slower than \siped and \operb.




\stitle{{Exp-2.2}: Impacts of the sizes of trajectories}.
To evaluate the impacts of the number of data points in a trajectory (\ie the size of a trajectory),
we chose $10$ trajectories from each dataset \ucar, \geolife, \mopsi and \act, respectively,
and varied the size \trajec{|T|} of trajectories from $1,000$ points to $10,000$ points, while fixed error bound $\epsilon = 60$ meters.
The results are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:time-size-ped} and Figure~\ref{fig:time-size-sed}.

\sstab(1) One-pass algorithms \siped, \operb and \cised scale well with the increase of trajectory size \eat{on all datasets} and show a linear running time, while batch and online algorithms do not.
This is consistent with their time complexity analyses.

\sstab(2) The running time from the smallest to the largest of these algorithms is the same as test {Exp-2.1}.

%\sstab (2) When using \ped, the running time from the smallest to the largest are one-pass algorithms \siped and \operb, and batch and online algorithms \tpa, \dpa and \bqsa. Algorithms \siped and \operb are comparable. Algorithms \tpa, \dpa and \bqsa are comparable, and they are on average \textcolor{red}{($3.8$--$5.3$, $3.5$--$4.8$, $4.6$--$7.2$, $6.2$--$8.4$)} times slower than the one-pass algorithms \siped and \operb on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively. 

%\sstab (3) When using \sed, the running time from the smallest to the largest are one-pass algorithm \cised, online algorithm \squishe, and batch algorithms \tpa and \dpa.  Algorithms \squishe, \tpa and \dpa are on average \textcolor{red}{($9.6$--$17.6$, $8.8$--$15.4$, $8.4$--$16.3$, $9.0$--$14.4$)}, \textcolor{red}{($9.6$--$17.6$, $8.8$--$15.4$, $8.4$--$16.3$, $9.0$--$14.4$)} and \textcolor{red}{($9.6$--$17.6$, $8.8$--$15.4$, $8.4$--$16.3$, $9.0$--$14.4$)} times slower than \cised on datasets (\ucar, \geolife, \mopsi, \act), respectively.

%\sstab (4) Batch algorithms \dpa and \tpa using \sed run a bit faster than using \ped, while the one-pass algorithm \cised run \textcolor{red}{$2.0$--$3.0$} times slower than \siped and \operb.

From these tests we find the following.

\emph{\sstab{(1) Compression ratios}}. 
(a) When using \ped, the output data sizes of sub-optimal algorithms (\tpa,
\dpa, \bqsa, \siped, \operb) are on average ($125.67\%$, $130.24\%$, $115.94\%$, $139.41\%$, $141.15\%$)
of the optimal algorithm \optp, respectively.
%the compression ratios from the best to the worst are the optimal algorithm \optp, batch and online algorithms \tpa, \dpa and \bqsa, and one-pass algorithms \siped and \operb. 
(b) When using \sed, the output data sizes of sub-optimal algorithms (\tpa,
\dpa, \squishe, \cised) are on average ($126.10\%$, $124.31\%$, $180.41\%$, $136.66\%$) of the near optimal algorithm \nopts, respectively.
%the compression ratios from the best to the worst are the near optimal algorithm \nopts, batch algorithms \tpa and \dpa, one-pass algorithm \cised, and online algorithm \squishe.  
(c) The compression ratios of algorithms using \ped are better than
using \sed. The output data sizes of algorithms (\optp, \tpa, \dpa) using \ped
are on average ($46.66\%$, $46.64\%$, $48.96\%$) of (\nopts, \tpa, \dpa) using \sed, respectively.

\emph{\sstab{(2) Average errors}}. 
(a) When using \ped, the average errors from the smallest to the largest are batch algorithms \tpa, \dpa, one-pass algorithms \siped and \operb, the optimal algorithm \optp, and online algorithm \bqsa. 
(b) When using \sed, the average errors from the smallest to the largest are online algorithm \squishe, batch algorithms \tpa and \dpa, one-pass algorithm \cised, and the near optimal algorithm \nopts.
