\section*{{Appendix: Semantic-based Trajectory Compression Algorithms}}
Apart from the techniques evaluated in this article, there exist other approaches for various requirements of trajectory compression, most notable the semantic-based methods.
%
The trajectories of certain moving objects such as cars and trucks are constrained by road networks. These moving objects typically travel along road networks, instead of the line segment between two points. Trajectory compression methods based on road networks \cite{Chen:Trajectory, Popa:Spatio,Civilis:Techniques,Hung:Clustering, Gotsman:Compaction, Song:PRESS, Han:Compress}  project trajectory points onto roads (also known as Map-Matching). Moreover, \cite{Gotsman:Compaction, Song:PRESS, Han:Compress} mine and use high frequency patterns of compressed trajectories, instead of roads, to further improve compression effectiveness.

Some methods \cite{Schmid:Semantic, Richter:Semantic} compress trajectories beyond the use of road networks, and further make use of other user specified domain knowledge, such as places of interests along the trajectories \cite{Richter:Semantic}.

These  semantics based approaches are orthogonal to line simplification based methods, and may be combined with each other to  improve the effectiveness of trajectory compression.
