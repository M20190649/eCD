% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'

% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.

% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Nowadays, various sensors are collecting, storing and transmitting tremendous trajectory data, and it is known that raw trajectory data seriously wastes the storage, network band and computing resource. Line simplification (\lsa) algorithms are an effective approach to attacking this issue by compressing data points in a trajectory to a set of continuous line segments, and are commonly used in practice.
\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.07,1.00}{However, existing  \lsa algorithms are not sufficient for the needs of sensors in mobile devices. In this study, we first develop a one-pass error bounded trajectory simplification algorithm (\operb), which scans each data point in a trajectory once and only once. We then propose an aggressive one-pass error bounded trajectory simplification algorithm (\operba), which allows interpolating new data points into a trajectory under certain conditions. Finally, we experimentally verify that our approaches (\operb and \operba) are both efficient and effective, using four real-life trajectory datasets.}
%Both \operb and \operba are around 4 to 5 times faster than \fbqsa, the fastest existing \lsa algorithm. In terms of compression ratio, \operb is comparable with \fbqsa, and \operba is \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{9.4\%} better than \dpa on average, the existing \lsa algorithm with the best compression ratio.
