In this paper, we proposed a novel trajectory simplification aware map-matching method, named \stmm. \stmm considers the characteristics of simplified
trajectories, such as the error bound of simplification and the geometric similarity between trajectories and paths/routes, so that it achieves a better accuracy and efficiency of map-matching for simplified trajectories.
We compared the accuracy and running time of the proposed method \stmm with two state-of-the-art
map-matching algorithms, namely \hmmbased and \gfbased, using two large-scale real
datasets. The experimental results show that, in most cases, ST-MM has the best accuracy and running time on both datasets.
%, \ie \stmm is on average $27\%$  and $15.3\%$ better than algorithms \hmmbased and \gfbased, respectively.
%In terms of running time, \stmm runs $2.1$ and $2.5$ times faster than algorithms \hmmbased and \gfbased, respectively.
%All these results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of \stmm on simplified trajectories.
