This technique is novel in that it simultaneously learns a unified model of the traveler's current mode of transportation as well as his most likely route, in an unsupervised manner. The model is implemented using particle filters and learned using Expectation-Maximization. The training data is drawn from a GPS sensor stream that was collected by the authors over a period of three months. We demonstrate that by adding more external knowledge about bus routes and bus stops, accuracy is improved.",

It uses a simple Markov model to make probabilistic predictions by looking at a driver¡¯s just-driven path. The model is trained from the driver¡¯s long term trip history from GPS data. We envision applications including driver warnings, anticipatory information delivery, and various automatic vehicle behaviors. The algorithm is based on discrete road segments, whose average length is 237.5 meters. In one instantiation, the algorithm can predict the next road segment with 90% accuracy. We explore variations of the algorithm and find one that is both simple and accurate. Video | Award.},

@article{Greenfeld2002b,
abstract = {GPS based navigation and route guidance systems are becoming increasingly popular among bus operators, fleet managers and travelers. To provide this functionality, one has to have a GPS receiver, a digital map of the traveled network and software that can associate (match) the user's position with a location on the digital map. Matching the user's location has to be done even when the GPS location and the underlying digital map have inaccuracies and errors. There are several approaches for solving this map matching task. Some only match the user's location to the nearest street node while others are able to locate the user at specific location on the traveled street segment. In this paper a topologically based matching procedure is presented. The procedure was tested with low quality GPS data to assess its robustness. The performance of the algorithms was found to produce outstanding results},

abstract = {Third-generation personal navigation assistants (PNAs) (i.e., those that provide a map, the user's current location, and directions) must be able to reconcile the user's location with the underlying map. This process is known as map matching. Most existing research has focused on map matching when both the user's location and the map are known with a high degree of accuracy. However, there are many situations in which this is unlikely to be the case. Hence, this paper considers map matching algorithms that can be used to reconcile inaccurate locational data with an inaccurate map/network.},
