The current submission is an extended version of the paper ``{\em Scaling up Link Prediction with Ensembles}''  that
appeared in the proceedings of the 9th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), San Francisco, CA, USA, 2016.

In particular, this submission includes the following new materials: (a) an optimizing method for speeding up top-k predictions w.r.t. a threshold (Section 2.2), (b) an edge filter technique to reduce the sizes of ensembles while keeping the high prediction accuracy (Section 3.4), and (c) a more detailed experimental study, including the limitation discussion of our approach (Section 4).
