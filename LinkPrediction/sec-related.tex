The link prediction problem has been studied extensively in the data mining and machine learning community
\cite{kleinberg,linyuan-2011}, which falls into unsupervised and supervised methods \cite{propflow}. Unsupervised methods
often assign scores to potential links based on the topology of the given graphs:
(a) Adamic/Adar \cite{adamic} is a common neighbor based method; (b) Katz \cite{katz-1953} is a
path based method which sums over all paths between two nodes, and there are also other path based
methods, such as Local Path and Random Walk with Restart \cite{linyuan-2011}; And (c)
\marked{\cite{kunegis,kleinberg, zhai2015} } investigates the low rank approximation methods by generating a
small rank matrix to approximate the initial adjacency matrix. Supervised methods
\marked{\cite{Link09,propflow,lichen3,chen2015,subbian2015} }typically treat link prediction as a classification problem, e.g., supervised matrix factorization and random walk based approaches \cite{menon,back}.

Recently, several models for link prediction have been proposed,
such as  community affiliation models \cite{Yang09,yang-wsdm2013}, stochastic topic models \cite{barbieri2014},
negative link prediction models \cite{tang2015}, statistical relational models \cite{bilgic,Getoor01,Getoor02,Taskar03,yu}
and Markov models \cite{zhu}. Moreover, link prediction has also been studied for mining
missing hyperlinks \cite{adafre,west2015}.
While some recent work has focused on the heterogeneous \cite{qi,sun11,sun12,tang,yang}, temporal \cite{back,dwang} scenarios, \marked{dynamic networks \cite{zhu2016}, coupled networks \cite{dong2015}, 
graph streams \cite{zhao2016} and signed networks \cite{song2015kdd}. Some optimizing methods for link recommendation have been proposed to improve the precision at the top of the recommending list \cite{song2015} or improve the user centrality in the network \cite{parotsidis2016}.}
These methods are not essentially
designed to search the entire space of $O(n^2)$ possibilities. Indeed, they are often not able to prune the search space of possibilities, and are mostly designed to evaluate the link prediction propensities of a subset of node pairs.

Our method is related to \NMF proposed in \cite{NMF-nature99}, which
has been successfully used for collaborative
filtering \cite{web}. Since the adjacency matrix in our approach is symmetric, we adopt
the symmetric \NMF method \cite{ding}. \marked{Methods for retrieving large entries in the product of
two matrices have been studied in \cite{ballard2015, lemp}, which motivate us to speed up the
top-$(\epsilon, k)$ prediction.} Our work is also related
to bagging predictor \cite{Breiman96b-1996} that generates an aggregated
predictor based on multiple bootstrap samples. Different from the bootstrap
sampling methods, we focus on sampling subgraphs from large networks. Although a
variety of graph sampling techniques \marked{  and analyze were introduced
in \cite{ahmed2014tkdd,li2015,zhou2015,nazi2015,chierichetti2016} }
, our approach combines link
prediction characteristics \cite{leskovec-2008} with graph sampling
methods to achieve high link prediction accuracy.

%The problem of link prediction has been studied extensively in the
%data mining and machine learning community \cite{chancc,lichen2,propflow}. Much of
%the work on this problem is based on defining proximity-based
%measures on the nodes in the underlying network
%\cite{adamic,kleinberg}. The work in \cite{kleinberg} studied the
%usefulness of different topological features for link prediction. A
%second approach is to study the problem in the context of
%statistical relational models \cite{bilgic,Getoor01,Getoor02,yu}.
%However, these methods are restricted to relational models, and  are
%not designed for dynamic networks, or cannot handle attributes of a
%relational nature. Recently, the problem of link prediction has also
%been studied in the context of wikipedia and web data
%\cite{adafre,zhu}. Methods for using supervised random walks for
%performing link prediction are proposed in \cite{back}. The negative
%link prediction has been investigated in \cite{tang2015} with only
%positive links and content-centric interactions in social media. A
%stochastic topic model WTFW (Who to Follow and Why) has been proposed for
%predicting links together with their types of explanation over directed
%and nodes-attributed graphs in \cite{barbieri2014}.
%
%
% The link
%prediction problem has also been studied more generally in the
%context of the classification problem \cite{propflow}, since the
%link prediction problem can be considered as a classification
%problem in which features and class labels (corresponding to
%existence or absence  of links) can be associated with links to be
%predicted. While some work has focussed recently on some aspects of
%the heterogeneous scenario \cite{sun11,sun12,yang}. Some of the
%methods have also been proposed for the  temporal scenario
%\cite{back,dwang}.  Recently, the use of supervised
%methods~\cite{propflow} and  latent factor models~\cite{menon} for
%link prediction has gained increasing importance. However, these
%methods are not essentially designed for searching the space of
%$O(n^2)$ possibilities. Most methods in the literature are not
%naturally designed to prune the space of possibilities for the link
%prediction problem and are generally designed to {\em evaluate} the
%link prediction propensities of a subset of node pairs.
