This study extends our earlier work \cite{liang2016} by adding
(a) an optimizing method for speeding up top-$k$ predictions \wrt a threshold (Section~\ref{sec-NMF-topk-optimization}), (b) an edge filter technique to reduce the sizes of ensembles while keeping the high prediction accuracy (Section~\ref{subsec-lp-char}), and (c) a more detailed experimental study, including the limitation discussion of our approach (Section~\ref{sec-exp}).




The link prediction problem has been studied extensively in the data mining and machine learning community
\cite{kleinberg,linyuan-2011}, and has various applications  \cite{adom,kunegis,kleinberg,barbieri2014,back,tang2015}.
The link prediction algorithms can be classified into unsupervised and supervised methods \cite{propflow}. Unsupervised methods
often assign scores to potential links based on the topology of the given graphs:
(a) Adamic/Adar \cite{adamic} is a common neighbor based method; (b) Katz \cite{katz-1953} is a
path based method which sums over all paths between two nodes, and there are also other path based
methods, such as Local Path and Random Walk with Restart \cite{linyuan-2011}; And (c)
\cite{kunegis,kleinberg, zhai2015} investigate the low rank approximation methods by generating a
small rank matrix to approximate the initial adjacency matrix. Supervised methods
\cite{Link09,propflow,chen2015} typically treat link prediction as a classification problem, \eg supervised matrix factorization and random walk based approaches \cite{menon,back}.

Recently, several models for link prediction have been proposed,
such as  community affiliation models \cite{yang-wsdm2013}, stochastic topic models \cite{barbieri2014},
negative link prediction models \cite{tang2015} and statistical relational models \cite{bilgic,Getoor01,Getoor02}.
Moreover, link prediction has also been studied for mining
missing hyperlinks \cite{west2015}.
While some recent work has focused on the heterogeneous \cite{yang}, temporal \cite{back,dwang} scenarios, dynamic networks \cite{zhu2016}, coupled networks \cite{dong2015},
graph streams \cite{zhao2016} and signed networks \cite{song2015kdd}. Some optimizing methods for link recommendation have been proposed to improve the precision at the top of the recommending list \cite{song2015}.
These methods are not essentially
designed to search the entire space of $O(n^2)$ possibilities. Indeed, they are often not able to prune the search space of possibilities, and are mostly designed to evaluate the link prediction propensities of a subset of node pairs.

Our method is related to \NMF proposed in \cite{NMF-nature99}, which
has been successfully used for collaborative
filtering \cite{web}. Since the adjacency matrix in our approach is symmetric, we adopt
the symmetric \NMF method \cite{ding}.  Methods for retrieving large entries in the product of
two matrices have been studied in \cite{ballard2015, lemp}, which motivate us to speed up the
top-$(\epsilon, k)$ prediction. Our work is also related
to bagging predictor \cite{Breiman96b-1996} that generates an aggregated
predictor based on multiple bootstrap samples. Different from the bootstrap
sampling methods, we focus on sampling subgraphs from large networks. To our knowledge, although a
variety of graph sampling techniques have been introduced
in \cite{ahmed2014tkdd,li2015,chierichetti2016}, our approach is the first work that combines link
prediction characteristics \cite{leskovec-2008} with graph sampling
methods to achieve the high link prediction accuracy.
