\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-con}

We have studied how to speed-up (exact)  shortest path and distance queries on large weighted undirected graphs.
To do this, we have proposed  a light-weight data reduction technique, a notion of proxies such that each proxy represents a small subgraph, referred to as \dras, such that proxies and \dras can be computed efficiently in linear time.  We have also verified,
both analytically and experimentally, that proxies significantly reduce graph sizes and improve efficiency of existing methods.
