\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-con}

We have studied how to speed-up (exact)  shortest path and distance queries on large weighted undirected graphs.
To do this, we  propose  a light-weight data reduction technique, a notion of proxies such that each proxy represents a small subgraph, referred to as \dras. We have shown that
proxies and \dras can be computed efficiently in linear time, and incur only a very small amount of extra space.  We have also verified,
both analytically and experimentally, that proxies significantly reduce graph sizes and improve efficiency of existing methods, such as bidirectional Dijkstra, \arcflag, \tnr and \ah for shortest path and distance queries.
