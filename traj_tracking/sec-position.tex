\section{Effective one-pass tracking in circular areas}
\label{sec:circular}

ldrh is a efficient traj tracking algorithm, suffer in compression ratio.
Observing one-pass algorithms, cised using sed, having
low time complexities and good compression ratios.

\subsection{Tracking by spatio-temporal cone}

spatio-temporal cone

ldr/ldrh is a sub set of cone/half-cone: theory and proof

uses spatio-temporal cone in traj tracking, two versions: strong and weak.

\subsection{strong tracking}

-- principle, adjust velocity.

-- full cone with constraint: theory and proof

-- algorithm

-- example

-- correctness and complexity

\subsection{Weak tracking}

-- theorem: if ldr is true, then the intersection of those cones must not be \{$P_s$\}.
means that, if ldr is true, it is sure those points can be represented by a line segment.
thus, we only need to check the intersection after ldr is false, during the process.

-- algorithm

-- example

-- correctness and complexity
