\section{Customized Tracking}
\label{sec:position}


\subsection{Customizing regions}

the distance metric used in tracking ``the distance between the expecting position and the actual position" ... it is SED in trajectory simplification. 

scope: It is  a CIRCLE around the expecting position. fig.

Limitations.

we can make these regions more flexible as soon as we include another distance metric, PED, in trajectory simplification with a little modification.

scope: fig.

advantages and applications.

besides, dad... tracking the direction deviation of a moving object.
