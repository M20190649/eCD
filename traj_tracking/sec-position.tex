\section{Tracking in non-circular areas}
\label{sec:position}


\subsection{Customizing areas}
in tracking, area is connected with distance metrics.

the distance metric used in tracking ``the distance between the expecting position and the actual position" ... it is SED in trajectory simplification. 

scope: It is  a CIRCLE around the expecting position. fig.

Limitations.

we can make these regions more flexible as soon as we include another distance metric, PED, in trajectory simplification with a little modification.

scope: fig.

advantages and applications.

besides, dad... tracking the direction deviation of a moving object.
 
\subsection{Position tracking in non-circular areas}
based on ldr


\subsection{Trajectory tracking in non-circular areas}
extends ldrh and grts to track in customized regions:

based on ldrh: proofs of ped and dad

based on grts: ldr + dp.
