\section{Effective one-pass tracking in circular areas}
\label{sec:circular}

\ldrh is an efficient trajectory tracking algorithm but suffer in effectiveness (compression ratios).
Observing one-pass algorithms, \cised using \sed, having low time complexity and good compression ratios, this inspires us to develop an efficient as well as effective trajectory tracking algorithm.

\subsection{Tracking by spatio-temporal cone}
\cised \cite{Lin:Cised} is a one-pass trajectory simplification algorithm using \sed, using a local synchronous distance checking approach based on a concept of spatio-temporal cone, defined in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system whose $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $t$-axis are longitude, latitude and time, respectively, that converts the \sed distance tolerance into the intersection of cones for testing the successive points.




\stitle{Spatio-temporal cones (\cone{}) \cite{Lin:Cised}}. 
Given a start point $P_s$ of sub-trajectory $\dddot{\mathcal{T}}_s[P_s, \ldots, P_{s+k}]$ and an error bound $\epsilon$, the spatio-temporal cone (or simply \textit{cone}) of a data point $P_{s+i}$ ($1\le i\le k$) in $\dddot{\mathcal{T}_s}$ \wrt $P_s$ and $\epsilon$, denoted as \cone{(P_s, P_{s+i}, \epsilon)}, or \cone{_{s+i}} in short, is an oblique circular cone such that point $P_s$ is its apex and the synchronous circle $\mathcal{O}(P_{s+i}, \epsilon)$ of point $P_{s+i}$, or \circle{_{s+i}} in short, a circle on the plane $P.t-P_{s+i}.t = 0$ such that $P_{s+i}$ is its center and $\epsilon$ is its radius, is its base.


\begin{example}
	\label{exm-circles-cones}
	Figure~\ref{fig:cis} shows 
	(1) two synchronous circles, \circle{(P_{s+i}, \epsilon)} of point $P_{s+i}$ and \circle{(P_{s+k}, \epsilon)} of point $P_{s+k}$.
	It is easy to see that for any point in the area of a circle \circle{(P_{s+i}, \epsilon)}, its distance to $P_{s+i}$ is not greater than $\epsilon$, 
	and (2) two example spatio-temporal cones, \cone{(P_s, P_{s+i}, \epsilon)} {(purple)} and \cone{(P_s, P_{s+k}, \epsilon)} (red), with the same apex $P_s$ and error bound $\epsilon$. %\eop
\end{example}

%Note that in this definition, a \emph{synchronous circle} $\mathcal{O}(P_i, \epsilon)$ is only defined by a central point $P_i$ and a constant $\epsilon$. Indeed, it is nothing to do with any start point $P_s$ or end point $P_e$.


%\textcolor{blue}{We define \textit{synchronous circles and Spatio-temporal cones} in a \emph{x-y-t} 3D coordinate system, and build the connection between \textit{synchronous circles} and \textit{synchronous distances}.}

\cite{Lin:Cised} proves that the \sed distance tolerance can be checked by finding the common intersection of spatio-temporal cones, \ie~\emph{given a sub-trajectory $[P_s,...,P_{s+k}]$ and an error bound $\epsilon$, $sed(P_{s+i}, \vv{P_sP_{s+k}})\le \epsilon$ for each $i \in [1,k]$ if  $\bigsqcap_{i=1}^{k}$\cone{(P_s, P_{s+i}, \epsilon/2)} $\ne \{P_s\}$}.
It also projects the cones on a plane so as to convert the checking of cones intersection into a much simpler way, \ie the checking of circles intersection on the plane. Finally a one-pass trajectory simplification algorithm \cised is developed based on the spatio-temporal cone intersection. 

%We next show that the cones intersection approach is much more effective than the policy used in \ldrh. Actually, the latter is just a special case of the former.

\begin{theorem}
\label{theo-ldrh-cised}
Given a sub-trajectory $\dddot{\mathcal{T}}_s[P_s,...,P_{s+k}]$, an error bound $\epsilon$ and a velocity $\vv{v}$, if $\dddot{\mathcal{T}}_s$ can be represented by line segment $\vv{P_sP_{s+k}}$ through algorithm \ldrh, then it can also be represented by the line segment through algorithm \cised.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\todo{1. $\vv{v}$ in 3D space; 2...}

if $|P_{s+i}P'_{s+i}|\le \epsilon/2$ for each $i \in [1,k]$, then $\vv{v}$ must live in the common intersection of cones $\bigsqcap_{i=1}^{k}$\cone{(P_s, P_{s+i}, \epsilon/2)}, where $P'_{s+i}$ is the synchronized point of $P_{s+i}$ \wrt $\vv{v}$.
\end{proof}

Theorem \ref{theo-ldrh-cised} tells that \ldrh is a special case of, and has worse effective than, \cised. Hence, the spatio-temporal cone intersection is a better way to develop a one-pass trajectory tracking algorithm. 
%
We next present two trajectory tracking algorithms, strong tracking and weak tracking, based on spatio-temporal cones.


\subsection{Strong tracking}

-- principle, adjust velocity.

-- algorithm CITT-S(e/2), spatio-temporal cone intersection based trajectory tracking (CITT) pcode and desc.

-- example

-- correctness and complexity

------------------------------

--- extend from half cone to full cone

-- full cone with constraint: theory and proof

-- algorithm CITT-S(e)

-- example

\subsection{Weak tracking}

-- theorem: if ldr is true, then the intersection of those cones must not be \{$P_s$\}.
means that, if ldr is true, it is sure those points can be represented by a line segment.
thus, we only need to check the intersection after ldr is false, during the process.

-- algorithm CITT-W(e)

-- example

-- correctness and complexity
