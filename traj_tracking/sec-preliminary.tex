\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec-pre}

\subsection{Notations}
(distance metrics, connecting with areas.)

points

trajectories

position tracking

trajectory compression

trajectory tracking


sed (..., currently, all tracking algorithm use sed, and sed is also one of distance metrics used in trajectory simplification.)

ped (..., a distance metric used in trajectory simplification, and currently not used in any tracking algorithm)

dad (..., another distance metric)


\subsection{Position tracking in circular areas}

position tracking: ldr

summary: excepting position -> sed; circular area the excepting position.

\subsection{Trajectory tracking in circular areas}
summary: 
where line simplification is ...

ldrh: (1). new start point, the point before the deviation point. (2). half epsilon
(The pre-set and solid velocity, and half epsilon make it have poor compression ratio)
