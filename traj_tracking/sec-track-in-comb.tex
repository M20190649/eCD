variants of ped and sed.

\subsection{Position tracking in combined areas}
based on ldr


\subsection{Trajectory tracking in combined areas}

combine cone, sector, interval with ldr; what's sector, interval.


strong tracking

-- principle, adjust velocity...
	checking \textcolor{blue}{separately} of cone, sector and interval ($P_sP_{s+k-1}$ is the choice), couple with ldr.
	step 1: check metrics: (if all intersections of one metric are true, then there must be a line segment satisfying all).
	if any intersection of one metric is false, then new line segment.
	step 2:	(check ldr) if any ldr is false, then find the common intersection of all metric and adjust velocity; select a point from the common area (or simply $P_{s+k-1}$).

-- algorithm. intersection based trajectory tracking (ITT-S)

-- example

-- correctness and complexity

weak tracking

-- principle, adjust velocity...
	must checking \textcolor{blue}{consistently} of cone, sector and interval, couple with ldr.
	if the common intersection of all metrics is false, then new line segment.
	otherwise, checks ldr, 	if any ldr is false, then adjust velocity, point select from the common area.
