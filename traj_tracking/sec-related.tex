grts has good compression ratio, but, 1. buffer, 2. separate compression and position tracking.

why not integrate one-pass algorithms with GRTS? 
1. one pass algorithm do not need a buffer; 2. a one-pass algorithm runs in a manner similar with ldr, 
inspire us to develop effective and efficient trajectory tracking methods that combine compression and position tracking into a consistent algorithm, and run in one-pass manner.
