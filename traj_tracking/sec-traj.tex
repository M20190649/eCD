\section{Tracking in combined areas}
\label{sec:combine}


\subsection{Combining circular and strip areas}
in tracking, area is connected with distance metrics.

the distance metric used in tracking ``the distance between the expecting position and the actual position" ... it is SED in trajectory simplification. 

scope: It is  a CIRCLE around the expecting position. fig.

Limitations.

we can make these regions more flexible as soon as we include another distance metric, PED, in trajectory simplification with a little modification.

scope: fig.

advantages and applications.

besides, dad... tracking the direction deviation of a moving object.


\subsection{Position tracking in combined areas}
based on ldr


\eat{
\subsection{Trajectory tracking in combined areas}
extends ldrh and grts to track in customized regions:

based on ldrh: proofs of ped and dad

based on grts: ldr + dp. 
}


\subsection{Trajectory tracking in combined areas}

combine cone, sector, interval with ldr; what's sector, interval


strong tracking

-- principle, adjust velocity...
	checking \textcolor{blue}{separately} of cone, sector and interval ($P_sP_{s+k-1}$ is the choice), couple with ldr.
	step 1: check metrics: (if all intersections of one metric are true, then there must be a line segment satisfying all).
	if any intersection of one metric is false, then new line segment.
	step 2:	(check ldr) if any ldr is false, then find the common intersection of all metric and adjust velocity; select a point from the common area (or simply $P_{s+k-1}$).

weak tracking

-- principle, adjust velocity...
	must checking \textcolor{blue}{consistently} of cone, sector and interval, couple with ldr.
	if the common intersection of all metrics is false, then new line segment.
	otherwise, checks ldr, 	if any ldr is false, then adjust velocity, point select from the common area.
