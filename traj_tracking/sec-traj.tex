\section{Effective one-pass tracking}
\label{sec:traj}
ldr is a efficient traj tracking algorithm, suffer in compression ratio.
grts has good compression ratio, but, 1. buffer, 2. separate compression and position tracking.
Observing one-pass algorithms, cised using sed, siped using ped, interval using dad
low time complexities and good compression ratios, compared with dp...
why not integrate one-pass algorithms with GRTS? 
1. one pass algorithm do not need a buffer; 2. a one-pass algorithm runs in a manner similar with ldr, 
inspire us to develop effective and efficient trajectory tracking methods that combine compression and position tracking into a consistent algorithm, and run in one-pass manner. 

\subsection{Efficient tracking in circles}

spatio-temporal cone and uses it to compress traj

combine st-cone with ldr; what's cone


two algorithms: strong tracking and weak tracking

Strong tracking: 

-- principle, adjust velocity.

-- algorithm

-- example

-- correctness and complexity

Weak tracking:

-- theorem: if ldr is true, then the intersection of those cones must not be \{$P_s$\}.
means that, if ldr is true, it is sure those points can be represented by a line segment.
thus, we only need to check ldr during the process.
