Algorithms for shortest  paths and distances have been extensively studied since 1950's, and fall into different categories in terms of different criteria:

 \bi
 \item exact distances~\cite{WuXDCZZ12,Dijkstra59,FredmanT84,LubyR89,GeisbergerSSD08,SankaranarayananSA09,SandersS05,GoldbergH05,MozesS12,ChengKCC12,MozesS12,ChanL07,SaundersT07,WagnerW07,bast2014route,delling2014robust,arz2013transit,zhu2013shortest,klein2010shortest,fakcharoenphol2006planar,gupta2004roads}
     and approximate distances~\cite{PotamiasBCG09,SarmaGNP10,ThorupZ05,SankaranarayananS10},


 \item memory-based~\cite{PotamiasBCG09,SarmaGNP10,WuXDCZZ12,Dijkstra59,FredmanT84,LubyR89,GeisbergerSSD08,Wei10,SankaranarayananSA09,SandersS05,
ThorupZ05,MozesS12,SaundersT07,WagnerW07,bast2014route,delling2014robust,arz2013transit,SankaranarayananS10,zhu2013shortest,klein2010shortest,gupta2004roads} and disk-based algorithms~\cite{ChengKCC12,ChanL07},


 \item for unweighted~\cite{PotamiasBCG09,SarmaGNP10,Wei10,bast2014route,delling2014robust,arz2013transit} and weighted graphs~\cite{WuXDCZZ12,Dijkstra59,FredmanT84,LubyR89,GeisbergerSSD08,SankaranarayananSA09,GoldbergH05,MozesS12,SandersS05,ChengKCC12,ThorupZ05,MozesS12,ChanL07,SaundersT07,WagnerW07,bast2014route,delling2014robust,arz2013transit,SankaranarayananS10,zhu2013shortest,klein2010shortest,fakcharoenphol2006planar,gupta2004roads},
     and


 \item for directed~\cite{SaundersT07,GoldbergH05,MozesS12,bast2014route,delling2014robust,arz2013transit,zhu2013shortest,klein2010shortest,fakcharoenphol2006planar} and undirected graphs~\cite{PotamiasBCG09,SarmaGNP10,WuXDCZZ12,Dijkstra59,FredmanT84,LubyR89,GeisbergerSSD08,Wei10,SankaranarayananSA09,SandersS05,ChengKCC12,ThorupZ05,MozesS12,ChanL07,WagnerW07,bast2014route,delling2014robust,arz2013transit,SankaranarayananS10,gupta2004roads}.

In this work, we study the memory-based (exact) shortest path and shortest distance problem on weighted undirected large graphs. 
%
We next introduce those methods that fall into this category from two aspects: on general graphs and on road networks.

\stitle{Approaches for general graphs}.
The classic solution for shortest path and distance queries is Dijkstra's algorithm \cite{Dijkstra59}. It visits nodes in ascending order of their distances from the source node and all nodes that are closer to the source node than the target node will be visited. Thus, several techniques are proposed to reduce the search space \cite{LubyR89, GoldbergH05}. (1) Bidirectional Dijkstra search \cite{LubyR89} is proposed to search from both source and target node. (2) ALT \cite{GoldbergH05} selects a set of nodes (reffered to as landmarks) and precomputes the distances from each node to landmarks, and uses the distances to prune unnecessary nodes during the search. (3) An edge labeling method named ArcFlag \cite{MohringSSWW05} cuts the graphs into partitions to reduce the search space.
(4) Wei \cite{Wei10} and Delling et al.\cite{delling2014robust} study the problem of computing exact query on large scale graphs??.
(5) A landmark-based method \cite{PotamiasBCG09} is proposed to estimate distance in large networks??.


\eat{
Though these studies improve the efficiency for answering shortest path and distance queries, they are inefficient for large scale graphs. Hence, many techniques have been proposed \cite{ChengKCC12, delling2014robust, PotamiasBCG09, Wei10}. Cheng et al. \cite{ChengKCC12} propose a novel disk-based index for processing single-source shortest path or distance queries. Wei \cite{Wei10} and Delling et al.\cite{delling2014robust} study the problem of computing exact query on large scale graphs.

\stitle{Approaches for road networks}.
Numerous work focuses on processing shortest path and distance queries on road networks. Different from general graphs, the shortest paths on road networks are often spatially coherent. Path oracles have been proposed for spatial networks~\cite{SankaranarayananSA09}, which utilize this property of spatially coherent. Morever, road networks are usually assumed to be planar graphs with non-negetive weights\cite{fakcharoenphol2006planar,gupta2004roads,klein2010shortest,MozesS12}. By utilizing the properties of road networks, many techniques\cite{SandersS05, GeisbergerSSD08, zhu2013shortest} are proposed. For example, Sanders et al. propose a route planning method named Highway Hierarchies (HH)\cite{SandersS05}. They construct a highway hierarchy such that only high level edges need to be considered to compute the path and distance from a source to a far target. Inspired by HH, Geisberger et al.\cite{GeisbergerSSD08} propose a road network index named Contraction Hierarchies (CH), which is a extreme case of HH. Zhu et al. further propose Arterial Hierarchy (AH)\cite{zhu2013shortest} that narrows the gap between theory and practice in answering shortest path and distance queries.

Note that to achieve a better query efficiency, most of the aforementioned approaches incur much preprocessing time and space overhead. Though these methods use different indices for query processing, our proxy can be used as a pre-processing step before these methods are applied. Specifically, since the routing proxies can represent their DRAs, we can use our method as a data reduction technique and reduce graph sizes by removing all the nodes in the DRAs. Then, these techniques can be applied on the reduced graph. These techniques benefit from the reduced graph in terms of both preprocessing and query answering.


\stitle{1-dominator sets}. Most close to our work is the study of 1-dominator sets in~\cite{SaundersT07}. Different from the aforementioned techniques, it is proposed for shortest path queries on nearly acyclic directed graphs rather than undirected graphs. When an undirected graph is converted to an equivalent directed graph, each undirected edge is replaced by a pair of inverse directed edges. Hence, 1-dominator sets~\cite{SaundersT07} are not applicable for undirected graphs. Routing proxies and deterministic routing areas proposed in this study  are for undirected graphs,  and  significantly different from 1-dominator sets (from definitions to analyses to algorithms).
