In this section, we compare the performance of algorithms using \ped VS. \sed. Two pairs of algorithms are tested, namely, (1) the algorithm \dpa using \ped and \sed, respectively, and (2) the sector intersection  algorithm \cite{Williams:Longest, Sklansky:Cone} using \ped and our spatio-temporal cone intersection algorithm using \sed.

\stitle{Exp-4.1: Impacts of distance metrics on compression ratios (\ped vs \sed)}.
To evaluate the impacts of distance metrics, \ie \ped and \sed, on compression ratios, we fixed {$m$=$16$} and varied $\epsilon$ from $10$ meters to $200$ meters on the entire four datasets, respectively.
The results are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:cr-ped} .


Given the same error bound $\epsilon$, the compression ratios of algorithms using \ped are obviously better
than using \sed.
More specifically, the compression ratios of algorithms \dpa 
using \ped are on average ($47.1\%$, $55.5\%$, $60.7\%$, $44.7\%$) of algorithm \dpa using \sed and
the compression ratio of algorithm \cist is on average
($45.4\%$, $54.5\%$, $60.1\%$, $43.0\%$) of algorithm \cia  on datasets (\sercar, \geolife, \mopsi, \pricar), respectively.



\stitle{Exp-4.2: Impacts of distance metrics on average errors (\ped vs \sed)}.
To evaluate the impacts of distance metrics on average errors, we fixed {$m$=$16$} and varied $\epsilon$ from $10$ meters to $200$ meters on the entire four datasets, respectively.
The results are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:ae-ped} .


Given the same error bound $\epsilon$, the average errors of algorithms using \sed are a bit larger than using \ped. 

The average errors of \dpa  using \ped is on average
($76.7\%$, $77.6\%$, $79.7\%$, $63.0\%$) of \dpa  using \sed, and  the average
errors of algorithm \cia  is on average
($97.5\%$, $78.1\%$, $92.4\%$, $74.2\%$) of algorithm \cist on datasets (\sercar, \geolife, \mopsi, \pricar), respectively.



\stitle{Exp-4.3: Impacts of distance metrics on running time (\ped vs \sed)}.
To evaluate the impacts of distance metrics on running time, we also fixed {$m$=$16$} and varied $\epsilon$ from $10$ meters to $200$ meters on the entire four datasets, respectively.
The results are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:time-ped} .

Given the same error bound $\epsilon$, the running time of \dpa  using \ped is on average
($24.3\%$, $119.9\%$, $23.4\%$, $91.3\%$) of \dpa  using \sed, and  the running
time of algorithm \cia  is on average ($7.0\%$, $36.3\%$, $19.9\%$, $69.2\%$)
of algorithm \cist on datasets (\sercar, \geolife, \mopsi, \pricar), respectively.
