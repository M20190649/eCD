We have proposed \cist and \cista, two one-pass error bounded strong and weak trajectory simplification algorithms using the synchronous distance.
%We have theoretically proved that both \cist and \cista have linear time and constant space complexities.
We have also experimentally verified that algorithms \cist and \cista are fast and have good compression ratios.
They are three times faster than \squishe, the most fast existing \lsa algorithm using \sed.
%
In terms of compression ratio,
algorithm \cist is close to \dps, the existing \lsa algorithm with the best compression ratio, and is $21.1\%$ better than \squishe on average; and algorithm \cista is better than all the sub-optimal algorithm and is on average $19.6\%$ and $42.4\%$ better than \dps and \squishe, respectively.

%For future work, we plan to develop optimal and near optimal algorithms using \sed that work effectively and efficiently on large trajectory data.
