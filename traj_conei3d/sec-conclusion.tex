We have proposed \cisto, a near optimal error bounded trajectory simplification algorithms using the  synchronous distance,  and \cist and \cista, two one-pass error bounded strong and weak trajectory simplification algorithms using the synchronous distance.
%We have theoretically proved that both \cist and \cista have linear time and constant space complexities.
We have also experimentally verified that algorithms \cist and \cista are both efficient and effective.
They are three times faster than \squishe, the most efficient existing \lsa algorithm using \sed.
%
In terms of compression ratio, 
algorithm \cisto has the best compression ratios among strong trajectory simplification algorithms;
algorithm \cist is {comparable} with \dps, the existing \lsa algorithm with the best compression ratio, and is $21.1\%$ better than \squishe on average; and 
algorithm \cista is comparable with \cisto and is on average $19.6\%$ and $42.4\%$ better than \dps and \squishe, respectively.
