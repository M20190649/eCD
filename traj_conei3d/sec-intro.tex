Various mobile devices, such as smart-phones, on-board diagnostics, personal navigation devices, and wearable smart devices, have been using their sensors to collect massive trajectory data of moving objects at a certain sampling rate (e.g., a data point every $5$ seconds), which is transmitted to cloud servers for various applications such as location based services and trajectory mining.
%
Transmitting and storing raw trajectory data consumes too much network bandwidth and storage capacity \cite{Chen:Trajectory, Meratnia:Spatiotemporal, Liu:BQS, Muckell:Compression,Cao:Spatio, Popa:Spatio,Nibali:Trajic}. %Schmid:Semantic, Richter:Semantic, Long:Direction,
%Further, we find that the online transmitting of raw trajectories also seriously aggravates several other issues such as out-of-order and duplicate data points in our experiences when implementing an online vehicle-to-cloud data transmission system.
%These issues can be resolved or greatly alleviated by trajectory compression techniques via removing redundant data points of trajectories \cite{Douglas:Peucker, Hershberger:Speeding, Meratnia:Spatiotemporal, Liu:BQS, Muckell:survey, Muckell:Compression, Chen:Trajectory, Chen:Fast,Cao:Spatio, Shi:Survey, Nibali:Trajic}, % Keogh:online, Richter:Semantic, Long:Direction, Song:PRESS
%
%Trajectory compression techniques remove redundant data points of trajectories,
%, or replace original data points in a trajectory with other places of interests, such as roads and shops.
%A large number of trajectory compression techniques have been developed,
% among which the piece-wise line {simplification}  technique is widely used \cite{Douglas:Peucker, Hershberger:Speeding, Liu:BQS, Muckell:Compression, Chen:Trajectory, Chen:Fast, Cao:Spatio, Shi:Survey}, due to its distinct advantages: (a) simple and easy to implement, (b) no need of extra knowledge and suitable for freely  moving  objects \cite{Popa:Spatio}, and (c) bounded errors with good compression ratios.

It is known that these issues can be resolved or greatly alleviated by trajectory compression techniques via removing redundant data points of trajectories \cite{Douglas:Peucker, Hershberger:Speeding, Meratnia:Spatiotemporal, Liu:BQS, Muckell:survey, Muckell:Compression, Chen:Trajectory, Cao:Spatio, Shi:Survey, Nibali:Trajic, Long:Direction, Popa:Spatio, Han:Compress, Chen:Fast}, among which the piece-wise line simplification technique is widely used \cite{Douglas:Peucker, Meratnia:Spatiotemporal, Muckell:survey, Muckell:Compression, Chen:Trajectory, Cao:Spatio, Shi:Survey, Liu:BQS, Lin:Operb, Chen:Fast}, due to its distinct advantages: (a) simple and easy to implement, (b) no need of extra knowledge and suitable for freely  moving  objects, and (c) bounded errors with good compression ratios \cite{Popa:Spatio,Lin:Operb}.

\caption{\small A trajectory $\dddot{\mathcal{T}}[P_0, \ldots, P_{10}]$  with eleven points is represented by two (left) and four (right) continuous line segments (solid blue), compressed by the Douglas--Peucker algorithm \cite{Douglas:Peucker} using \ped and \sed, respectively. The Douglas--Peucker algorithm firstly creates line segment $\protect\vv{P_0P_{10}}$, then it calculates the distance of each point in the trajectory to $\protect\vv{P_{0}P_{10}}$. It finds that point $P_{4}$ has the maximum distance to $\protect\vv{P_{0}P_{10}}$, and is greater than the user defined threshold $\epsilon$. Then it goes to compress sub-trajectories $[P_0, \ldots, P_{4}]$ and $[P_{4}, \ldots, P_{10}]$, separately.

Originally, line simplification (\lsa) algorithms adopt the \emph{perpendicular Euclidean distance} (\ped) as a metric to compute the errors,
\eg $|\vv{P_4P^*_4}|$ is the \ped of data point $P_4$ to the line $\overline{P_0P_{10}}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:notations} (left).
Line simplification algorithms using \ped have good compression ratios~ \cite{Douglas:Peucker, Hershberger:Speeding, Liu:BQS, Muckell:Compression, Chen:Trajectory, Cao:Spatio, Shi:Survey}.  However, when using \ped, the temporal information is lost. Thus, a spatio-temporal query, \eg ``\emph{the position of a moving object at time $t$}", on the compressed trajectories by \lsa algorithms using \ped may return an approximate point $P'$ whose distance to the actual position $P$ of the moving object at time $t$ is unbounded. %For example, a query for the position of $P_7$ at time $t_7$ may return an approximate data point $P'_7$ whose distance to $P_7$ is great than the  bound $\epsilon$ in Figure~\ref{fig:notations} (left).


\eat{, of a data point to a proposed generalized line (\eg in Figure~\ref{fig:notations} (left), $|P_4P^*_4|$ is the \ped of $P_4$ to the line $\overline{P_0P_{10}}$) as the condition to discard or retain that data point.
\lsa algorithms using \ped have good compression ratios and are error bounded on \ped, hence they are widely used in scenarios that compression ratio is the most concerned factor. However, when using \ped, the temporal information of trajectory points is lost. Thus, a temporal-spatio query, \eg ``\emph{the position $P$ of a moving object at time $t$}", on trajectories compressed by \lsa algorithms using \ped returns an approximated point $P'$ whose distance to the actual position $P$ at time $t$ is unbounded. For example, a query at time $t_7$ returns an approximated point $P'_7$ whose distance to the point $P_7$ is great than the threshold $\epsilon$.

,  and implemented it in Douglas-Peucker (\dpa)~\cite{Douglas:Peucker} algorithm
}


The \emph{synchronous Euclidean distance} (\sed) was then introduced for trajectory compression to support the above spatio-temporal queries \cite{Meratnia:Spatiotemporal}. \sed is the Euclidean distance of a data point to its \emph{approximate temporally synchronized data point \cite{Meratnia:Spatiotemporal}} on the corresponding line segment. For instance, $P'_4$ and $P'_7$ are the \emph{synchronized data points} of points $P_4$ and $P_7$ \wrt line segments $\vv{P_0P_{10}}$ and $\vv{P_4P_{10}}$, respectively, in Figure~\ref{fig:notations} (right).
\lsa algorithms using \sed may produce more line segments. However, the use of \sed ensures that the Euclidean distance between a data point and its  synchronized point \wrt the corresponding line segment is limited within by a distance bound $\epsilon$. Hence, the above spatio-temporal query over the trajectories compressed by \sed enabled approaches returns the synchronized point $P'$ of a data point $P$ within the bound $\epsilon$.


%No matter using \ped or \sed, 

The problem of finding the minimal number of line segments to represent the original polygonal lines \wrt an error bound $\epsilon$ is known as the ``min-\#" problem\cite{Imai:Optimal,Chan:Optimal}. 
	% For this problem, there exists the optimal \lsa algorithm using \sed whose time complexity is $O(n^3)$.
An optimal $O(n^3)$  \lsa algorithm using \ped was firstly developed in \cite{Imai:Optimal},  where $n$ is the number of the original points.
	%
	Later, an improved optimal  $O(n^2)$  algorithm using \ped was designed in \cite{Chan:Optimal}, with the help of \textit{sector intersection} mechanism.
	However, the time complexity of the optimal \lsa algorithm using \sed remains in $O(n^3)$, as the optimization mechanisms are \ped specific, and cannot work with \sed.

 %	The high time complexities of the optimal \lsa algorithms using \sed make them impractical.
Due to the high time complexities of optimal \lsa algorithms using \sed, sub-optimal \lsa algorithms using \sed have been developed for trajectory compression, including batch algorithms (\eg Douglas-Peucker based algorithm \dpsed \cite{Meratnia:Spatiotemporal}) and online algorithms (\eg\ \squishe \cite{Muckell:Compression}).
However, these methods still have a high time and/or space complexity, which hinders their utility in resource-constrained devices. %\cite{Lin:Operb}


Observe that linear time \lsa algorithms using \ped \cite{Williams:Longest, Sklansky:Cone, Dunham:Cone, Zhao:Sleeve, Lin:Operb} have been develped, and they are more efficient for resource-constrained devices.
%
The key idea to achieve a linear time complexity is by local distance checking in constant time, \eg \textit{sector intersection} mechanism used in \cite{Williams:Longest, Sklansky:Cone, Dunham:Cone, Zhao:Sleeve} and the \textit{fitting function} approach used in our preview work \cite {Lin:Operb}.
Unfortunately, these techinques are designed specifically for \ped, and cannot be applied for \sed.


Indeed, it is even more challenging to design an one-pass \lsa algorithm using \sed than using \ped.
To our knowledge,  no one-pass \lsa algorithms using \sed have been develoed in the community.





\stitle{{Contributions}}.
To this end, we propose two one-pass error bounded \lsa algorithms using \sed for compressing trajectories in an efficient and effective way. % error bounded

\sstab {(1)} We first develop a novel local synchronous distance checking approach, \ie spatio-temporal \underline{C}one \underline{I}ntersection using the \underline{S}ynchronous \underline{E}uclidean \underline{D}istance (CISED).
%, by extending the sector intersection method \cite{Williams:Longest, Sklansky:Cone, Zhao:Sleeve}\eat{(Section~\ref{sec-localcheck})}.
We further approximate the intersection of spatio-temporal cones with the intersection of regular polygons, and develop a fast regular polygon intersection algorithm, such that each data point in a trajectory is checked in $O(1)$ time during the entire process of trajectory simplification.

%\sstab {(2)} \textcolor{blue}{We then show that an optimal trajectory simplification algorithm using \sed can achieve $O(n^2 \log n)$ time by using our local synchronous distance checking technique, and provide a \textit{near optimal} trajectory simplification algorithm \cisto that achieves $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n)$ space.}

\sstab {(2)} We next develop two one-pass trajectory simplification algorithms \cist and \cista, achieving $O(n)$ time complexity and $O(1)$ space complexity, based on our local synchronous distance checking technique.
Algorithms \cist belongs to strong simplification that only has original points in its outputs, while algorithm \cista belongs to weak simplification that allows interpolated data points in its output.


\sstab (3) Using four real-life trajectory datasets (\truck, \sercar, \geolife, \pricar),
we finally conduct an extensive experimental study, by comparing our methods \cist and \cista  with the optimal \lsa algorithm using \sed, \dps~\cite{Meratnia:Spatiotemporal} (the most effective existing \lsa algorithm using \sed) and \squishe \cite{Muckell:Compression} (the most efficient existing \lsa algorithm using \sed).

For running time,
algorithms \cist and \cista are on average ($14.21$, $18.19$, $17.06$, $9.98$), ($2.84$, $3.45$, $3.69$, $2.86$) and ($925.25$, $7888.26$, $40041.59$, $8528.76$) times faster than \dps, \squishe and the optimal \lsa algorithm on datasets (\sercar, \geolife, \mopsi, \pricar), respectively.

For compression ratios, algorithm \cist is better than \squishe and comparable with \dps. The output sizes of \cist are on average ($79.5\%$, $79.5\%$, $66.0\%$, $72.7\%$),
($109.1\%$, $109.7\%$, $113.5\%$, $109.2\%$) and ($134.3\%$, $133.3\%$,
  $148.4\%$, $135.4\%$) of \squishe, \dps and the optimal \lsa algorithm on datasets (\sercar, \geolife, \mopsi, \pricar), respectively.
Moreover, algorithm \cista is comparable with the optimal \lsa algorithm and better than \squishe and \dps that are on average ($57.9\%$, $58.8\%$, $48.4\%$, $54.6\%$),
($79.6\%$, $81.2\%$, $83.3\%$, $82.1\%$) and ($98.1\%$, $98.7\%$, $108.9\%$,
  $101.7\%$) of \squishe, \dps and the optimal \lsa algorithm on datasets (\sercar, \geolife, \mopsi, \pricar), respectively.
