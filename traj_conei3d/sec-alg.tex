\section{One-Pass Trajectory Simplification}
\label{sec-alg}

Following \cite{Trajcevski:DDR,Lin:Operb}, we consider two classes of trajectory simplification.
The first one, referred to as \emph{strong simplification}, that takes as input a trajectory \trajec{T} and an error bound $\epsilon$, and produces
a simplified trajectory \trajec{T'} such that all data points in \trajec{T'} belongs to \trajec{T}.
The second one, referred to as \emph{weak simplification}, that takes input a trajectory \trajec{T} and an error bound $\epsilon$, and produces
a simplified trajectory \trajec{T'} such that some data points in \trajec{T'} may not belong to \trajec{T}. That is,  weak simplification allows data interpolation. %,commonly used in polygonal curve approximation \cite{Williams:Bounded, Heckbert:Survey, Zhao:Sleeve}, time series approximation \cite{ORourke:Fitting, Elmeleegy:Stream, Xie:Stream, Luo:Streaming} and trajectory simplification \cite{Lin:Operb}.


The main result here is stated as follows.

\begin{theorem}
\label{prop-cist-op}
There exist one-pass error bounded trajectory simplification algorithms using the synchronous distance for both strong and weak trajectory simplification.
\end{theorem}

We shall prove this by providing such algorithms for both strong and weak trajectory simplifications, by employing the constant time synchronous distance checking technique developed in Section~\ref{sec-localcheck}.

\subsection{Strong Trajectory Simplification}
Recall that in Propositions~\ref{prop-3d-ci} and~\ref{prop-circle-intersection}, the point $Q$ may not be in the input sub-trajectory $[P_s,...,P_{s+k}]$.
If we restrict $Q=P_{s+k}$, the end point of the sub-trajectory, then the cones whose base circles with a radius of $\epsilon/2$ suffice.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop-3d-ci-half}
Given a sub-trajectory $[P_s,...,P_{s+k}]$ and an error bound $\epsilon$, $sed(P_{s+i}, \vv{P_sP_{s+k}})\le \epsilon$ for each $i \in [1,k]$ if and only if $\bigsqcap_{i=1}^{k}$\cone{(P_s, \mathcal{O}(P_{s+i}, \epsilon/2))} $\ne \{P_s\}$.
\end{prop}


\begin{proof}
If $\bigsqcap_{i=s+1}^{e}{\mathcal{C}(P_s, P_{s+i}, \epsilon/2)} \ne \{P_s\}$, then by Proposition~\ref{prop-3d-ci}, there exists a point $Q$, $Q.t = P_{s+k}.t$, such that $sed(P_{s+i}, \vv{P_sQ})\le \epsilon/2$ for all $i \in [1,k]$. By the triangle inequality essentially, $sed(P_{s+i}, \vv{P_sP_{s+k}})\le  sed(P_{s+i}, \vv{P_sQ}) + |\vv{QP_{s+k}}| \le  \epsilon/2+\epsilon/2 = \epsilon$.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


 We first present the  one-pass error bounded {\em strong trajectory simplification} algorithm using the synchronous distance, which is shown in Figure~\ref{alg:CI3d}.

\stitle{Procedure \kw{getRegularPolygon}}.
We first present procedure \kw{getRegularPolygon} that given a cone projection circle, generates its inscribed $m$-edge regular polygon,  following the definition in Section~\ref{subsec-RPI}.

The parameters $P_s$, $P_i$, $r$ and $t_c$ together forms the projection circle \pcircle{(P^c_i, r^c_i)} of the spatio-temporal cone \cone{(P_s, \mathcal{O}(P_{i}, r))} of point $P_{i}$ \wrt point $P_s$ on the plane $P.t - t_c$ = $0$. Firstly, $P^c_i.x$ and $P^c_i.y$ are computed (lines 1--3), and $r^c_i = c\cdot r$.
Then it builds and returns an $m$-edge inscribed regular polygon $\mathcal{G}$ of \pcircle{(P^c_i, r^c_i)} (lines 4--8), by transforming a polar coordinate system
into a Cartesian one. Note that here $\theta$, $r\cdot\sin\theta$ and $r\cdot\cos\theta$ only need to be computed once during the entire processing of a trajectory.

\stitle{Algorithm \cist}. We now present algorithm Algorithm \cist. It takes as input a trajectory \trajec{T}${[P_0, \ldots, P_n]}$, an error bound $\epsilon$ and the number $m$ of edges for inscribed regular polygons, and returns a simplified  piece-wise line representation $\overline{\mathcal{T}}$ of $\dddot{\mathcal{T}}$.



The algorithm first initializes the start point $P_s$ to $P_0$, the index $i$ of the current data point to $1$, the intersection polygon $\mathcal{G}^*$ to $\emptyset$, the output $\overline{\mathcal{T}}$ to $\emptyset$, and $t_c$ to $P_1.t$, respectively (line 1).
%
The algorithm sequentially processes the data points of the trajectory one by one  (lines 2--10). It gets the $m$-inscribed regular polygon \wrt the current point $P_i$ (line 3) by calling procedure $\kw{getRegularPolygon}$. When $\mathcal{G}^* = \emptyset$, $\mathcal{G}^*$ is simply initialized as $\mathcal{G}$ (lines 4, 5). Otherwise,
$\mathcal{G}^*$ is  the intersection of the current regular polygon $\mathcal{G}$ with $\mathcal{G}^*$ by calling procedure $\rpia()$ introduced in Section~\ref{subsec-fastRPI} (line 7). If the resulting intersection $\mathcal{G}^*$ is empty, then a new line segment $\vv{P_sP_{i-1}}$ is generated (lines 8--10).
After the  final new line segment $\vv{P_sP_{n}}$ is generated (line 11), it returns the simplified  piece-wise line representation $\overline{\mathcal{T}}$ (line 12).

\begin{example}
\label{exm-alg-conest}
Figure~\ref{fig:exm-const} shows a running example of algorithm \cist for compressing the trajectory \trajec{T} in Figure~\ref{fig:notations}.
%For convenience, here, we project the points and the oblique circular cones on a x-y space.

\sstab (1) After initialization, the \cist algorithm reads point $P_1$ and builds a narrow \emph{oblique circular cone} \cone{(P_0, \mathcal{O}(P_{1}, \epsilon/2))}, taking $P_0$ as its apex and \circle{(P_1, \epsilon/2)} as its base (green dash). The \emph{circular cone} is projected on the plane $P.t-P_1.t=0$, and the inscribe regular polygon $\mathcal{G}_1$ of the projection circle is returned. As $\mathcal{G}^*$ is empty, $\mathcal{G}^*$ is set to $\mathcal{G}_1$.

\sstab(2) The algorithm reads $P_2$ and builds \cone{(P_0, \mathcal{O}(P_{2}, \epsilon/2))} (red dash). The \emph{circular cone} is also projected on the plane $P.t-P_1.t=0$ and the inscribe regular polygon $\mathcal{G}_2$ of the projection circle is returned. As $\mathcal{G}^*=\mathcal{G}_1$ is not empty, $\mathcal{G}^*$ is set to the intersection of $\mathcal{G}_2$ and $\mathcal{G}^*$, which is $\mathcal{G}_1 \bigsqcap \mathcal{G}_2 \ne \emptyset$.

\sstab (3) For point $P_3$, the algorithm runs the same routing as $P_2$ until the intersection of $\mathcal{G}_3$ and $\mathcal{G}^*$ is $\emptyset$. Thus, line segment $\vv{P_0P_2}$ is generated, and the process of a new line segment is started, taking $P_2$ as the new start point and $P.t-P_3.t=0$ as the new projection plane.

\sstab (4) At last, the algorithm outputs four continuous line segments, \ie $\{\vv{P_0P_2}$, $\vv{P_2P_4}$, $\vv{P_4P_{7}}$, $\vv{P_7P_{10}}\}$.
\end{example}





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Weak Trajectory Simplification}

We then present the one-pass error bounded {\em weak simplification} algorithm using the synchronous distance.

%, based on Proposition~\ref{prop-circle-intersection}.



\stitle{Algorithm \cista}.
Given a trajectory \trajec{T}${[P_0, \ldots, P_n]}$, an error bound $\epsilon$ and the number $m$ of edges for inscribed
regular polygons, its returns a simplified  piece-wise line representation $\overline{\mathcal{T}}$,
which may contain interpolated points.

By Proposition~\ref{prop-circle-intersection}, algorithm \cista generates spatio-temporal cones whose bases are circles with a radius of $\epsilon$,
and, hence, it replaces $\epsilon/2$ with $\epsilon$ (line 3 of \cist). It also generates new line segments with interpolated data points $Q$, and,
hence, it replaces point $P_i$ and line segment $\vv{P_sP_i}$  (line 9 of \cist) with $Q$ and $\vv{P_sQ}$, respectively,  such that $Q$ is generated as follows.


\begin{prop}
\label{prop-cist-Q}
Given a sub-trajectory \trajec{T}${[P_s, \ldots, P_{s+k}]}$ and an error bound $\epsilon$,  $t_c=P_{s+k}.t$ and $G^*_k$ be the intersection polygons of all polygons $G_{s+i}$ ($i\in[1,k]$) on the plane $P.t - t_c = 0$. If $G^*_k$ is not empty, then any point in $G^*_k$ is feasible for $Q$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
By Proposition~\ref{prop-circle-intersection} and the nature of inscribed regular polygon, it is easy to find that for any $Q \in G^*_k$  \wrt $t_c=P_{s+k}.t$, there is $sed(P_i, \vv{P_sQ})\le \epsilon$ for all points $P_{s+i}$ ($i \in [1,k]$). From this, we have the conclusion.
\end{proof}

The choice of $Q$ from $G^*_k$ may slightly affect the effectiveness (\eg average errors and compression ratios). However, the choice of an optimal $Q$ is non-trivial. For the benefit of efficiency, we apply the following strategies.

\sstab (1) If $P_e \in G^*_k$ \wrt $t_c=P_{s+k}.t$, then $Q$ is simply $P_{s+k}$.
%meaning the projection point of $P_e$ on the plane ``$t=t_c$", \ie $P^c_e$, is in the intersection polygon of regular polygons \{$\mathcal{G}_s, \dots, \mathcal{G}_e$\} of all projection circles \{$\mathcal{O}(P^c_s, \epsilon^c_s), \ldots, \mathcal{O}(P^c_e, \epsilon^c_e)$\},

\sstab (2) If $G^*_k \ne \emptyset$ and $P_{s+k} \not\in G^*_k$ \wrt $t_c=P_{s+k}.t$, then the central point of $G^*_k$ is chosen as $Q$.

\sstab (3)  If $t_c \ne P_{s+k}.t$, which is the general cases, then we project the intersection polygon $G^*_k$ \wrt $t_c \ne P_{s+k}.t$ on the plane $P.t -P_{s+k}.t = 0$, then we apply strategies (1) and (2) above. That is, the projection has no affects on the choice of $Q$.
%so as to get the $G^*_k$ \wrt $t_c = t_{s+k}$,

\begin{example}
\label{exm-alg-conesta}
Figure~\ref{fig:exm-consta}  shows a running example of algorithm \cista for compressing the trajectory \trajec{T} in Figure~\ref{fig:notations} again.


\sstab (1) After initialization, the \cista algorithm reads point $P_1$ and builds a \emph{oblique circular cone} \cone{(P_0, \mathcal{O}(P_{1}, \epsilon))}, and projects it on the plane $P.t-P_1.t=0$. The inscribed regular polygon $\mathcal{G}_1$ of the projection circle is returned. The intersection of polygon $\mathcal{G}_1$ and polygon $\mathcal{G}^*$ is $\mathcal{G}_1 \ne \emptyset$.

\sstab (2) $P_2$, $P_3$ and $P_4$ are processed in turn. The intersection polygons are not empty.

\sstab (3) For point $P_5$, the intersection of $\mathcal{G}_5$ and $\mathcal{G}^*$ is $\phi$. Thus, line segment $\vv{P_0Q} =\vv{P_0P'_4}$ is output, and a new process is started such that $Q=P'_4$ is the new start point and plane $P.t-P_5.t=0$ is the new projection plane.

\sstab (4) At last, the algorithm outputs 3 continuous line segments, \ie $\vv{P_0P'_4}$, $\vv{P'_4P_8}$ and $\vv{P_8P_{10}}$, in which $P'_4$ is an interpolated data points not in \trajec{T}.
\end{example}

\stitle{Correctness and complexity analyses}.
%
The correctness of algorithms \cist and \cista follows from Propositions~\ref{prop-circle-intersection} and~\ref{prop-3d-ci-half}, and Propositions~\ref{prop-circle-intersection} and~\ref{prop-cist-Q}, respectively.
%
It is easy to verify that each data point in a trajectory is only processed once, and each can be done in $O(1)$ time,
as both procedures  $\kw{getRegularPolygon}$ and $\rpia$ can be done in $O(1)$ time.
Hence, these algorithms are both one-pass error bounded trajectory simplification algorithms.
It is also easy to see that these algorithms take $O(1)$ space.

These together also complete the proof of Theorem~\ref{prop-cist-op}.
